For about 6-7 years we’ve stated that the number of Autodesk Revit add-ins installed on our machines increases exponentially, so that they interfere with each other in an unpredictable way and slow down the main program substantially.

To manage them we made use of Revit Add-In Manager of Stantec (http://www.stantec.com/).
Unfortunately the program doesn’t cover several problem arising: 

add-ins complete switch off / on

altering of security prompting (run always, run once, don’t run) when chosen

uninstall

So, we continued developing.

We're glad to have a feedback.
